# Eventure
- Eventure is an app which allows users to search and attend events that are going on nearby. Users can search for events by name or by map. They can register and log in to add emergency contacts. When a user has selected an event he/she is attending, Eventure will send them a message at a specified alert time, if the user responds that the event isn't going well, Eventure will contact the users Emergency Contacts. This is done using API's such as, Eventbrite, Google Maps React, and Twilio.
